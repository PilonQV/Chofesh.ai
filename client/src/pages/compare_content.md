# Chofesh vs. Hosted AI Chat: A Clear Choice for Privacy

When it comes to choosing an AI chat platform, the market is flooded with options. However, most of these platforms, including popular services like ChatGPT, operate on a hosted model. This means your data is sent to their servers for processing and storage, creating significant privacy and security risks. Chofesh, on the other hand, is built on a fundamentally different architecture—a local-first approach that puts you in control.

## The Hosted AI Chat Model: What You Give Up for Convenience

Hosted AI chat platforms are convenient, but that convenience comes at a cost. When you use these services, you are entrusting your most sensitive conversations to a third party. Here’s what that means:

*   **Data Collection:** Your conversations are collected and stored on corporate servers. This data is often used to train AI models, which means your private information could become part of a public-facing AI.
*   **Security Risks:** Storing data on a central server creates a single point of failure. If the provider’s servers are breached, your data could be exposed.
*   **Lack of Control:** You have limited control over your data. You may not be able to delete it permanently, and you have no say in how it is used.
*   **Censorship and Bias:** Hosted AI platforms often have strict content filters and biases that can limit your creative freedom and access to information.

| **Data Storage** | Local-first (on your device) | Server-side (on their servers) |
| **Encryption** | End-to-end (AES-256) | In transit (may not be end-to-end) |
| **Data Retention** | Zero data retention on our servers | Data is retained for model training | 
| **Privacy** | Your data is private and secure | Your data is used to train their models |
| **Control** | You have complete control over your data | You have limited control over your data |
| **Flexibility** | BYOK and Smart Model Routing | Limited to the provider’s models |
| **Censorship** | Uncensored chat (within legal limits) | Strict content filters and biases |

## How Deep Research Works

Our Deep Research feature combines the power of large language models with a robust web search engine to provide a comprehensive and reliable research experience:

*   **Inline Citations:** Every piece of information in our AI-generated summaries is linked to its source. This allows you to easily verify the information and dig deeper into the topics that interest you.
*   **Unbiased and Objective:** We are committed to providing unbiased and objective information. Our system is designed to present a balanced view of the topics you are researching, drawing from a diverse range of sources to avoid bias and misinformation.

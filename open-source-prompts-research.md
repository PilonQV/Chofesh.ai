# Open Source Prompts Research - January 2026

## Source: x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools/Open Source prompts

### Folders Found:
1. **Bolt** - Web development AI (WebContainer-based)
2. **Cline** - Code assistant
3. **Codex CLI** - OpenAI Codex CLI tool
4. **Gemini CLI** - Google Gemini CLI
5. **Lumo** - Unknown
6. **RooCode** - Code assistant

### Bolt Prompt Analysis:
- Expert AI assistant for software development
- Uses WebContainer (in-browser Node.js runtime)
- Limited to Python standard library only
- No pip, no third-party libraries
- Uses Supabase for databases
- Focuses on code generation with boltArtifact XML tags
- **NOT related to uncensored AI** - purely coding focused

### Key Observations:
The "Open Source prompts" folder contains prompts for open-source coding tools, NOT uncensored AI models. These are:
- Code generation assistants
- CLI tools
- Development environments

### Conclusion:
This repository does not contain uncensored AI configurations. It's focused on:
1. System prompts for coding assistants
2. Tool configurations for AI-powered IDEs
3. API integrations for development tools

For uncensored AI, the Venice Uncensored model via OpenRouter remains our best option.

## API Availability
- **Enterprise/API**: "Contact Sales" for API access
- No public API documentation found
- Crypto payments only (BTC, ETH, USDC, etc.)

## Key Features
- Unfiltered/uncensored image generation
- Multiple style options (Realistic, Artistic, Cinematic, etc.)
- Commercial use included
- Credits never expire

## Conclusion
BasedLabs does NOT have a public API - requires enterprise contact for API access.
This makes it unsuitable for direct integration into Chofesh.ai.

**Better alternatives for programmatic integration:**
1. Venice.ai API ($18/mo Pro) - Has documented API
2. Self-hosted Stable Diffusion - Full control, no restrictions
3. Replicate with uncensored models - API available

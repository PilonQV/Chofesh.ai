**Title:** Chofesh.ai – Privacy-First AI Platform with Uncensored Models and BYOK Support

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm excited to share **Chofesh.ai** – a privacy-first AI platform I've been building for people who want creative freedom without surveillance.

**What makes Chofesh different:**

🔒 **Privacy-First** – Your conversations are encrypted and stored locally on your device. We don't collect or store your chat data on our servers.

🎨 **Uncensored AI** – Access AI models that don't restrict creative expression. Perfect for writers, researchers, and anyone tired of "I can't help with that" responses.

🔑 **BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys)** – Use your own API keys from OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and more. Full control over your costs and usage.

🖼️ **Image Generation** – Create images with AI, with your generated images stored securely and accessible across devices.

💬 **Multiple AI Models** – Switch between different models based on your needs – from fast responses to more capable reasoning.

**Why I built this:**

I was frustrated with AI platforms that track everything, restrict creative use cases, and lock you into their pricing. Chofesh (Hebrew for "freedom") is built on the principle that AI should empower users, not surveil them.

**Pricing:**
- Free tier available
- Premium plans for power users
- BYOK option for maximum flexibility

Would love to hear your feedback! What features would make this more useful for you?

# Introducing Chofesh.ai: AI Freedom Without Compromise

The AI landscape has a problem. Major platforms track your every conversation, restrict creative expression, and lock you into expensive subscriptions. Your data becomes their product, and your creativity gets filtered through corporate content policies.

**Chofesh.ai is different.**

Chofesh (חופש) means "freedom" in Hebrew, and that's exactly what we're building – an AI platform that puts you in control.

## The Privacy Problem

When you use most AI chatbots, your conversations are stored on corporate servers, analyzed for training data, and potentially shared with third parties. Even "private" modes often have exceptions buried in terms of service.

At Chofesh.ai, we took a different approach:

- **Local-first storage**: Your conversations are encrypted and stored on your device
- **No data collection**: We don't train on your chats or sell your data
- **End-to-end encryption**: Your conversations stay between you and the AI

## Creative Freedom

We believe AI should enhance creativity, not restrict it. Writers exploring dark themes, researchers studying sensitive topics, and creators pushing boundaries shouldn't hit arbitrary content walls.

Chofesh.ai provides access to uncensored AI models that respect your creative autonomy while maintaining ethical guidelines against genuinely harmful content.

## Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK)

Tired of subscription lock-in? With BYOK support, you can:

- Use your own API keys from OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and other providers
- Pay only for what you use
- Switch providers without losing your workflow
- Maintain full transparency over your AI costs

## Features

- **Multi-model support**: Choose the right AI for each task
- **Image generation**: Create AI art with your prompts
- **Document chat**: Upload and discuss documents privately
- **AI personas**: Customize AI behavior for different use cases
- **Artifacts**: Generate code, documents, and more
- **Cross-device sync**: Access your image gallery from any device

## Who Is This For?

- **Privacy advocates** who want AI without surveillance
- **Creative professionals** who need unrestricted AI assistance
- **Developers** who want BYOK flexibility
- **Researchers** exploring sensitive topics
- **Anyone** frustrated with AI content restrictions

## Get Started

Chofesh.ai is live and free to try. No credit card required for the free tier.
